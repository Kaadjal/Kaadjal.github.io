                    Hello! I'm <span class="highlight-text">Kaadjal</span>, a passionate and driven individual with a keen interest in data analysis, data science and technology. My journey into coding began quite a few years ago when I built my first simple website, and since then, I've been fascinated by how technology can be used to solve real-world problems and create engaging experiences.
                </p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    I specialise in data analysis, and training towards data science. I enjoy creating dashboard, performing analysis and answering key questions. I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills.
                </p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    Beyond coding, I'm an avid learner, always exploring new concepts in technology, design, and even a bit of digital art. When I'm not at my keyboard, you might find me hiking, reading sci-fi novels, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    I believe in continuous improvement and open collaboration. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects and connect with fellow enthusiasts in the tech community. Feel free to reach out to me via any of the platforms below!
                </p>
